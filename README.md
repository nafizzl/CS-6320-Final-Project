# CS-6320-Final-Project

Note: The file is a standard Python file rather than a Google Colab Notebook because the notebook wasn't rendering properly, leaving excess raw code to sift through.
For the BERT model implemenetation, we simply changed the name of the model imported from Hugging Face, as otherwise everything else was the same in terms of implementation.
